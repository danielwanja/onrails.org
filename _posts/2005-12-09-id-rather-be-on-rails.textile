This statement is pretty true right now, Rails is just  a pleasant development environment. Mike Clark left this sticker at my desk at one of the places I am currently doing a Rails project at.

For another client I am doing a Flex project and work with many great java developers. I thought I would put the sticker in a visible spot and see their reactions. Well, it didn't fail, some of the comments where pretty funny. Here they go:

* That's a big statement.
* We'll run you out on a rail.
* So you would rather be on rails, hein?
* HuHan!
* You really are a geek.
* Where did you get it? You didn't get one for me?
* He's a convert.
* You are pushing the Ruby stuff today!
* It looks like it should have a Lenin on it.
* I'd rather be fishing.

The "Lenin" one I didn't totally get, even after a long discussion, but I sounded pretty funny to me. As you see, give me a sticker and will say good things about you. No, that's not the case, I just think Mike Clark and Dave Thomas are putting a very compelling training together, and with these two guys you will learn more in three days than you would ever in any other places.
