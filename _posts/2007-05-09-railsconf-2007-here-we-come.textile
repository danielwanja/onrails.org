I just completed a first pass at setting my schedule for RailsConf. 
<a href="http://myconfplan.com/users/Daniel/conferences/RailsConf2007">Check it out</a>  at MyConfPlan. In any case go check out MyConfPlan which is a pretty cool Rails application.
As usual I am looking forward meeting many of the people I have met last year. Also if you are from Switzerland and doing Rails work, try to hunt me down, I would love to talk to you. It's also fun that we are going to meet <a href="http://pea2.com">Kirk</a> again, and "old" mate from Denver that is now leaving in Portland.
