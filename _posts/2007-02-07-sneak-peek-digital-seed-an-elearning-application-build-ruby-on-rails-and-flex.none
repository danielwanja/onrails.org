Last year Sean and Greg asked us to join one of their venture as Ruby on Rails developers. <a href="http://www.doloresjoya.com/">Dolores</a> joined as designer. Like Sean <a href="http://voisen.org/archives/2007/02/06/digital-seed-a-sneak-preview/">describes it</a>  "Digital Seed is a Flash and Ruby on Rails application that has been designed to allow learning and training companies to more easily deliver their &ldquo;soft skills&rdquo; training (leadership, management, communications, etc.) in a multimedia-rich online learning environment.". This is a really fun project to work on. Sean put up a 10 minute <a href="http://www.digital-seed.com/">screencast</a>.
