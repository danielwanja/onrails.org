Fuzzy Clock is now free. I've added three new clocks, a Polar clock from  from the <a href="http://raphaeljs.com">RaphaÃ«l javascript library</a>, and two others are based on <a href="https://github.com/simonbaird/CoolClock">CoolClock</a>. In addition to three new clocks Fuzzy Clock now has a option to disable the Auto-Lock allowing the clock to run forever on a stand without having the lock screen appear.

Check out this video to see the new features.
