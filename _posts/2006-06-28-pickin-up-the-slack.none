I guess I'll have to try to pick up the slack while Daniel's trekking around Europe.  In case you don't know, I'm the guy named Lee that Daniel mentions from time to time.

Hopefully, I'll be able to fill some space here with some useful tidbits about Rails, Ferret, and whatever else looks interesting.

Have a great vacation, Daniel.  We'll leave the light on for ya.
