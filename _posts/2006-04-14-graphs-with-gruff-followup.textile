"The solution from the source":http://onrails.org/articles/2006/02/20/graphs-with-gruff#comments ;-) I checked it out and it now works as advertised, just add   g.minimum_value = 0 to the Gruff::Bar before rendering it (g.to_blob).

Note that axis starting at zero. 

| Without the minimum_value | With the minimum_value set to zero |
