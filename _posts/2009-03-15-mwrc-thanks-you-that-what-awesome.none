We are at the airport on the way back to Denver from the <a href="http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/2009/">MountainWest RubyConf</a>. This was the best conference I went to in years. Fast passed talk with just incredible material and every presenter was just excellent. So to the organizers and presenters....Thank you! I'll be back!
