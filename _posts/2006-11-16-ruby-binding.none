What is <code>binding</code>?  It basically holds the current state of the application... it knows what <code>self</code> is (or was when <code>binding</code> was invoked).  What else does it know?  I'm not sure, it's something I'd like to investigate further.  Can the binding be interrogated?  Can it be manipulated?

Let me know if you have good pointers to info about it.  I'll check Pickaxe when I get home.
