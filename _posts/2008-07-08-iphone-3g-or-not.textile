Since they announced the iPhone 3G I am pretty convinced that there isn't much new over my current iPhone. Camera is still 2Mega pixels, the plastic case is not so nice, gps is cool, but I have one in my car, 16Gb over 8 could be useful, form factor changed slightly so it may not fit in my car cradle. So it's basically the same phone with slightly faster internet.  But I'm such a sucker when it comes to gadgets and I was just reading this article on <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2109">How to replace an original iPhone with an iPhone 3G</a>. Now if only my wife didn't want my current iPhone, I wouldn't have to buy the new one :-)
