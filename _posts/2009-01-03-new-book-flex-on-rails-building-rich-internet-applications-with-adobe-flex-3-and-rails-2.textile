Finally our book on using Flex with Rails is released and will appear over the next few days  in stores around the US and is available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321543378?ie=UTF8&tag=flexonrails-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321543378">Amazon</a>.  I received a couple of copies from the publisher and it felt like an accomplishment to hold a physical version in my hands. I am sure my co-author, <a href="http://thillerson.blogspot.com/">Tony</a>, felt the same. Good job man!  With this release we are also launching <a href="http://flexonrails.com">http://flexonrails.com</a> where you can find all the source code of the book as well as other resources related to Flex and Rails, and our blog <a href="http://blog.flexonrails.com">http://blog.flexonrails.com</a> the blog for everything on Flex with Ruby On Rails...

So here are the top 10 reasons why should you absolutely buy this book even if you are not a programmer....1) Your vision will improve  2) You'll run faster 3) Aging gets reverted 4)... Just kidding, the main reasons for us to write this book was that we really wanted to share many of the experiences and findings we had on using Flex and Rails on many projects, and we are proud of the outcome. It's a book by developers for developers. I'll be blogging in a next entry about the process of writing this book, and will create a screencast presenting the different applications we are creating in the book,  so stay tuned. When writing the book we assumed that you where a developer, either a Flex developer or a Rails developer that needed to  interact with the other side and wanted to add Rails or Flex to it's battery of languages. You will certainly find your way around even if you don't know Flex or Rails. In either case we didn't create a reference book so you won't find all the answers about each api that is available in both frameworks, but you will find everything you need to get started integrating Flex with Rails, and delve into wonderful world of Flex on Rails applications. For the example code we didn't want to build a large application and refine it over time through the chapters, so most chapter contain one or several working applications  used to highlight the major integration aspects explained in that chapter.  And Rails is just fantastic to create small applications on the fly, and Flex and Actionscript is pretty good for that too. So to give you a better overview of the content of this book I have attached the official description and the table of content. For more info come back to <a href="http://blog.flexonrails.com">http://blog.flexonrails.com</a> and <a href="http://flexonrails.com">http://flexonrails.com</a>. I hope you enjoy the book and the sample applications. So go check it out and let us know what you think.

<h2>Description</h2>

â€œThereâ€™s no question youâ€™re going to be a better Flex and Rails developer when youâ€™re done reading this book.â€
â€“From the Foreword by Matt Chotin, Senior Product Manager, Adobe Systems, Inc.

Â 
Adobe Flex enables the rapid development of rich and engaging user experiences. Ruby on Rails dramatically simplifies the development of database-driven web applications. Now thereâ€™s a book that shows how to use the newest versions of both frameworks together to create state-of-the-art Rich Internet Applications (RIAs).

Â 
Flex on Rails begins with the absolute essentials: setting up your environment for Flex and Rails, passing data with XML, and integrating Flex front-ends with Rails back-ends. Then, using practical, easy-to-understand code examples, the authors take you from the basics to advanced topics only discussed in this book. Techniques covered here includeÂ 

* Constructing sophisticated interfaces that canâ€™t be created with AJAX alone

* Using RESTful services to expose applications for access via APIs

* Testing Flex and Rails together

* Using Flex Frameworks

* Getting Flex into your build/deploy process

* And moreâ€¦Â 

The authors also offer practical introductions to powerful complementary technologies, such as RubyAMF and Juggernaut.
Â 

Written by developers with extensive experience using both frameworks, this book covers the new Adobe Flex 3 and Ruby on Rails 2 from the ground up. Even if you have minimal experience with Flex or Rails, youâ€™ll learn all you need to know to use them to build exceptional production applications.
