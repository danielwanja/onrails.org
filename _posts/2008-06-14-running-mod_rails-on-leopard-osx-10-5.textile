From the command line:

<typo:code>
gem install passenger
sudo passenger-install-apache2-module
</typo:code>

The Apache 2 module was successfully installed.

Please edit your Apache configuration file, and add these lines:

   LoadModule passenger_module /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/passenger-1.0.5/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so
   RailsSpawnServer /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/passenger-1.0.5/bin/passenger-spawn-server
   RailsRuby /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/bin/ruby


Hey...where is the configuration. Google told me to read this blog entry: http://www.fuzzylizard.com/archives/2008/05/29/947/

So copy these three lines and add them to the end of this file:  /etc/apache2/httpd.conf 

$ sudo mate /etc/apache2/httpd.conf 

Start and stop Apache go the to the System Preferences|Sharing and select the Web Sharing  service:

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://onrails.org/files/20080616_syspref.jpg" alt="20080616_syspref.jpg" border="0" width="467" height="382" /></div>

Then the install script gives you the following instructions.

Deploying a Ruby on Rails application: an example

Suppose you have a Ruby on Rails application in /somewhere. Add a virtual host
to your Apache configuration file, and set its DocumentRoot to
/somewhere/public, like this:


   <VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerName www.yourhost.com
      DocumentRoot /somewhere/public
   </VirtualHost>


And that's it! You may also want to check the Users Guide for security and
optimization tips and other useful information:

  /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/passenger-1.0.5/doc/Users guide.html

Enjoy Passenger, a product of Phusion (www.phusion.nl) :-)

Now where is "my" apache configuration file? And more important where is yours? On the command line do

$ ls /etc/apache2/users/

And I see daniel.conf, so let's edit that one. I am developing one Rails app in this folder: /Users/daniel/SvnProjects/for/stockportfolio/rails. So let's define this application in that conf file:

$ sudo mate  /etc/apache2/users/daniel.conf

<typo:code>
<Directory "/Users/daniel/SvnProjects/for/stockportfolio/rails/">
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

<VirtualHost *:80>
   ServerName dev.stockportfolio.com
   DocumentRoot /Users/daniel/SvnProjects/for/stockportfolio/rails/public
</VirtualHost>
</typo:code>

Note the /public at the end of the folder in the DocumentRoot. 
Now I am adding dev.stockportfolio.com in my /etc/hosts file. So just add the following line

<typo:code>
127.0.0.1  dev.stockportfolio.com
</typo:code>

Now go back to the system preference sharing tab and restart the web service. Now you have your application running ... in production mode. Just point your browser to dev.stockportfolio.com.

Enjoy Daniel!
