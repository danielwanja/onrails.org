I didn't start watching <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/">Heroes</a> until after I heard <a href="http://richkilmer.blogs.com/">Rich Kilmer</a> and <a href="http://vernix.org/">Marcel Molina</a> talking about it while putting the badges together for RubyConf 2006 in Denver.&nbsp; Had I watched it before maybe I would have been a little scared of Marcel (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylar">Sylar</a>), but he was very nice and didn't <i>seem</i> like a threat to the Ruby world at all.

So, why be scared of Mr. Molina?  You be the judge.

<typo:code lang="ruby">
class MarcelMolina
  include Heroes
  
  def <=>(other_hero)
    other_hero.name == 'Sylar' ? 0 : 1
  end
end
</typo:code>
