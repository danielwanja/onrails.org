<span class="new" >Updated</span> time.onrails.org

The new functionality is  
<ul>
<li>Add notes to your time entries.  You can now add notes from the Dashboard or your project pages.</li> 
<li>Improved CSV export.</li>
</ul>

Some functionality I am considering next:
<ul>
<li>fixing the rendering in Internet Explorer. I just saw this bug since I installed Parallels on my MacBook pro. </li>
<li>Blinksale integration, I started to write the UI to submit a time section to generate an invoice via Blinksale, but I am still waiting to get access to the api. Unfortunatly I didn't make to the beta of the API. I even tried to convince Josh Williams from Firewheel Design, to let me in on it, but without success. Thanks Josh for the quick response anyhow!</li>
</ul>
