We were bored of the plain green on black syntax highlighting for our code blocks, not to mention sick of the weird borders around code comments, so I hunted around for a little to find something a little better.  The theme we're using, Scribbish, didn't have any CSS defined for Typo's code blocks, so I stole them from <a href="http://blog.wilf.me.uk/articles/2006/10/03/syntax-highlighting-for-scribbish">James Wilford's post</a>.  Thanks, James.

Maybe we'll tweak the colors some more later, but these will do for now.

<typo:code lang="ruby">
class Scribbish < TypoTheme
  include JamesWilfordCSS
end
</typo:code>
