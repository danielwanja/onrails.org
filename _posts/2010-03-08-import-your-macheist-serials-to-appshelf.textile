If you have purchased the latest MacHeist nano bundle, you might have noticed that there is no option this time to export as an AppShelf file.  I felt a little guilty spamming my twitter followers to get my three free bonus apps (Airburst Extreme, Tracks, and Burning Monkey Solitaire), so to atone, I'm sharing a script that will translate your reciept into an AppShelf import file.  Just save your receipt page from the browser, then pass the filename to this script as an argument:

    RUBYOPT=rubygems ruby generate-appshelf.import.rb MacHeist-Serial.html

The script will create an import file named "nano-bundle-3.appshelf" in your current directory.  Enjoy!
