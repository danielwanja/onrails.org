What a conference! The talks where really awesome so far. Not exactly sure what I will attend today. I might attend  "Optimize it! ActionScript Tips for iPhone Games" followed by "Adobe is from Mars, Microsoft is from Uranus: A View from the Client". Then I will have to split early to catch a flight to Salt Lake City for the <a href="http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/2010/">MountainWest RubyConf 2010</a>. 

<h3>Optimize it! ActionScript Tips for iPhone Games Renaun Erickson</h3>

Renaun is Plaform Evangelist for Adobe since last week. He will put up the slides and code on his <a href="http://renaun.com/blog/">blog</a> later today. Many of the tips are good for any Flash/Flex app not just for iPhone ones.

* Packager for iPhone (PFI)
* LLVM cross compiles

He will focus the talk on Memory/Cpu/Mouse Move and Game Timers.

Instead of going to the Flex/Silverlight talk, sorry Jun and Eric, I went to Nate Beck's talk on pushbutton. And Doug McCune had something special <a href="http://dougmccune.com/blog/2010/03/10/nate-becks-birthday-surprise-at-360flex/">planned</a> for Nate's birthday...
