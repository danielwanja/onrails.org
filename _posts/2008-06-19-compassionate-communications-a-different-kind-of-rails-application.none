I have been working with Sean and Lee on <a href="http://www.compassionatecommunications.com">Compassionate Communications</a> a Ruby on Rails website. My role was small thanks to the <a href="http://www.activemerchant.org/">ActiveMerchant</a> plugin, I helped with the online payment but my part was done in no time. The site launched just before Rails Conference and I wanted to write about what the site is. It's about giving, reaching out, helping...but I didn't find the right words to describe it. The team at <a href="http://www.compassionatecommunications.com/">Compassionate Communications</a> made the following video that captures the essence of what they want to achieve way better I could describe..so go check it out.
