I created the new _Playground_ category on this blog to expose various aspects regarding Ruby On Rails that I am exploring. It may raise more questions than provide answers, but in any case don't hesitate to jump in and add your 2 cents.

The _xml_builder_ method here after uses the _render_to_string method to create some xml structure. The xml_string could as well have been in a separate .rxml file and and a simple _render_ statement instead of _render_as_string_ could have saved one line of code. But hey, that's what the playground is for! 


<typo:code lang="ruby">
class PlaygroundController < ApplicationController
  
  def xml_builder
    xml_string = <<-XML_END
        xml.test do
          xml.language(name)
          xml.description("Rocks!")
        end
    XML_END
    result = render_to_string(:inline => xml_string, :locals => { :name => 'Ruby'}, :type => :rxml) 
    render_text result
  end
  
end

</typo:code>

The output: 
<typo:code lang="xml">
<test>
  <language>Ruby</language>
  <description>Rocks!</description>
</test>
</typo:code>
