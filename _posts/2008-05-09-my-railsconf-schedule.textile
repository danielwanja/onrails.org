I know..I know...it's a little early, but hey, I wanted to see what's talks they have, and there is really a bunch of goods ones. Here is my selection so far

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://onrails.org/files/20080508_RailsConfSchedule.jpg" alt="20080508_RailsConfSchedule.jpg" border="0" width="520" /></div>
