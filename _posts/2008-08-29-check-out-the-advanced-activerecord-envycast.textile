I just went through the first <a href="http://envycasts.com/">screencast</a> from the <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/">Rails Envy</a> guys'. I wasn't sure if I would liked the fact that they used a green screen approach, but thought I would support their effort as I really like their weekly podcast. Guess what? It's a really good screen cast, very informative, high quality and well done. Wait, there is more, they have a cool Cheat Sheet that comes with the download. Well worth the money, go <a href="http://envycasts.com/">check it out</a>.
