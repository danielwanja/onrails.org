Actually, I guess they made us less poor.&nbsp; Last month a bunch of our referrals finally paid off, saving us 70% of our usual monthly fee!&nbsp; Thanks go to Kevin, Richard, Marty, John, Christopher, Brandon, Zachary, Piotr, and Jesse!<br /><br />Why haven't we written much about <a href="http://www.slicehost.com/">Slicehost</a> in the 6 months we've been hosting on them?&nbsp; Because it just works.&nbsp; We just set up our apps and let them run.<br /><br />If you'd like to be in our next thank you note, use this <a href="https://manage.slicehost.com/customers/signup?referrer=629092">link</a> when signing up for your slice.<br /><br />Thanks again, referrals and Slicehost.<br />
