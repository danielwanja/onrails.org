Time.onrails.org - a simple time tracking application has been updated. 

* Time shifting -  Let's assume you entered time from 08:00-12:00 13:00-17:00. Then you notice that you effectively took a longer lunch. Simply edit the 12:00 to 11:45, then tab to the next field and change 13:00 to 13:15 and press enter. In the same way, if you didn't come back from lunch at all that day. Simply clear out the 13:00-17:00 field and press enter. This will delete this time slot.

*  Running Timers - When a timer is running (i.e. 11:30- ), the time line (day) is highlighted in green. That way it's easy to detect which timers are still running.

* IE6 Support. Time entry was pretty broken with IE. This should have been fixed. I haven't installed IE7...so I assume it doesn't work there. 

* Rails Migration. Behind the scenes Rails was migrated from 1.1.6 to 1.2.3.

Please let me know if you find anything unusual.

Enjoy!
