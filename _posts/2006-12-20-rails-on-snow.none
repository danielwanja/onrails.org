In case you haven't heard, we're getting a "little" snow today in Colorado.&nbsp; We have 3-4 foot drifts in the middle of our back yard.&nbsp; Most flights out of the Denver Internation Airport have been cancelled, but the Rails coding never stops.<br /><br /><img src="http://onrails.org/files/0.jpg" /><br /><br />It's not too cold, but the wind blew snow in through our dog door.&nbsp; Our poor beagle is having a hard time trying to find a place to do his business.<br /><br /><img src="http://onrails.org/files/2.jpg" /><br /><br />Anyway... back to unit tests.<br />
