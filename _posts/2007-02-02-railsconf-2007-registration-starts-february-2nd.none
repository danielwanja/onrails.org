UPDATED:  <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/51/register.html">REGISTER NOW!</a>

I just received notification that my proposal for a talk at RailsConf was declined. The subject was of course, "Flex On Rails - Enterprise Data Manipulation.". I hope that my friend <a href="http://thillerson.wordpress.com/">Tony</a> which made a proposal on a similar subject has been accepted. He is an excellent teacher. In addition the notification indicated that the registration starts tomorrow. So get ready!
