For those in or near Seattle you might want to check out the new <a href="http://www.seattleonrails.org/">Rails group</a> that is starting this month.&nbsp; It is sponsored by <a href="http://www.engineyard.com/">Engine Yard</a> and my friend's company, <a href="http://www.biego.com/">Biego</a>.&nbsp; The first meeting is February 13th at 6pm at the Greenlake Public Library.&nbsp; Too bad it wasn't last week when I was in Seattle for a few days, I would have liked to seen what the Ruby community is like there.<br />
