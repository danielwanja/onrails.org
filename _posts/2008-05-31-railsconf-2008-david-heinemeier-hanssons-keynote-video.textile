Part of dhh's message was to spread the message...so I assume I should be fine to publishing  these extracts from David's keynote. I was sitting at the back of the room and took some videos snapshot. I didn't film all the talk as I didn't have a tripod, but this will give you a nice overview of the what was going on during the talk...Rails is pretty big, there where lots of people there...and David was going beyond technology and telling the attendance that all Rails developers should seize the opportunity Rails create  to improve themselves and not only from a technical point of view. Check it out.

Warning: I didn't edit the video and didn't have a tripod so it's quite ruff and shaky. Also oreilly is going to publish an high quality official one.

<strong>Update</strong>: video was gone...seems to be back now.
