 !/files/20060515_railsloganalyzer.gif! 

I started to write a small Rails Log Analyzer that provides some insight on how a given application is used. I've just spent three hours so far, so not too much to show, but I have found the integration of Flex with Rails for read-only purpose of the different time series pretty straight forward. 

h2. In two words...

RAILS: data.to_json

FLEX: JSON.decode(String(srv.lastResult));

h2. On the Rails side 

The controller simply transforms the Hash return by the model into a json textual representation.

<typo:code lang="ruby" title="the controller">
class DataController < ApplicationController

  def overview
    render :text => Hit.overview_data.to_json
  end
  
end
</typo:code>

This is an extract of the method that returns a Hash that contains the time series in an Array. 

<typo:code lang="ruby" title="the model">
def Hit.overview_data
    result = {}
    result[:header] = {:period => {:start => Hit.minimum(:time).to_s(:db), :end => Hit.maximum(:time).to_s(:db)}}
    result[:sessions_series] =
           {:by_day => Hit.data_serie(Hit.count(:session, :group => :day, :conditions => 'controller <> "HeartbeatController"'), "sessions by day")    }
    result
  end
</typo:code>   

h2. On the Flex side

<typo:code  title="the view">

   import com.macromedia.serialization.json.*;

   private function resultHandler(event:ResultEvent) : void
        {
        	status = "Loaded. Parsing data...";
            var result:Object = JSON.decode(String(srv.lastResult));
            header = result.header;
            ts = getSerie(result.sessions_series.by_day.data);

  }

    <mx:HTTPService id="srv" url="http://10.37.129.2:3000/data/overview" result="resultHandler(event)" />


</typo:code>   


The service is invoked by the following actionscript call

<typo:code lang="ruby">
		srv.send()
</typo:code>

JSON doesn't support Date objects out of the box, but it's a nice way to exchange complex data such a Hash and Map between Rails and Flex.
