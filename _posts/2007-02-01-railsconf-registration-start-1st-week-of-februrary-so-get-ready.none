The conference Wiki <a href="http://wiki.oreillynet.com/wiki/railsconf2007/index.cgi?WhenWillRegOpen">indicates</a> that the registration starts the first week of February. Chad just <a href="http://chadfowler.com/2007/2/1/railsconf-registration">notified</a> the community that it's coming soon. I speculate the registration opens tomorrow, February 1st. Rumored to be around $800.- and having more seats than the 700 of last year, it may take a little longer to sell the conference out this time. Let's see. In any case get ready!
