This is the data for onrails.org

It is automatically transformed by Jekyll into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

Onrails.org was a very active blog for many years with many visitors. Thank you all for visiting onrais.org over time. 
However this blog was neglected since I started also bloging at my company blog http://n-so.com/blog. So I decided to retire onrails.org and keep this archive for posterity.
